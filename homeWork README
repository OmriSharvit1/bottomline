HI
Purpose: 	Describe what I did in order to implement what I was asked for in this assignment.
Description:	This is README file for the homework assignment on spring-boot application, Docker and Kubernetes. 
Environment: 	Linux on Ubuntu 16.04.5 VM
Created by: 	Omri Sharvit
**************************************************************************************************************

Spring-boot Application:

1) Installed Java 8 and configured $JAVA_HOME in system PATH
2) Installed latest eclipse version for Java development
3) Installed Maven(m2e) plugin for eclipse
4) Created a Maven project called 'hw-assignment' 
5) Added Spring-Boot framework as parent in the pom.xml
6) Added dependency for spring-boot-starter-web in the pom.xml for having all that needs for creating a web application via spring-boot framework
7) Created package for the 'main' class called 'io.Bottomline.hwAssignemnt'
8) Created class 'BottomlineApiApp' with a static main function which is the SpringBootApplication
9) Created class 'HelloController' for the RestController which contains the function helloworld to handle request to the root page('/') as described in the assignment
10) Added support for 'uber' jar in the pom.xml file under the <build> section:
	a) At first i tried use plain maven-build-plugin but encountered a problem to use spring-boot framework so i changed it to spring-boot-maven-plugin
	b) Added the 'maven'assembly' under the <build> section with the descriptor of 'jar-with-dependencies' to create an 'uber' jar 
11) build the application using 'mvn clean package' command from the 'hw-assignment' directory

Docker container:

1) Installed Docker latest version
2) Created the 'Dockerfile' 
3) Build it via termianl with the 'hw' tag 
4) Run it via terminal 'docker run -p 9090:8080 hw' which maps the container 8080 port to the host port 9090 so the application can be accessed via 'localhost:9090/'

Kubernetes Deployment:

1) installed 'kubctl' 
2) installed 'minikube' with 'vm-driver=none' 
3) launched 'minikube' 
4) Created a deployment file 'deploy.yaml' for the hw container and tried to deploy it
	a) The deployment failed as i didn't had a user and repository on the docker hub website
	b) I created a user 'omrisg' and a repository 'bottomline' (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/omrisg/bottomline)
	c) I tagged the hw container as omrisg/bottomline:hw and pushed it to my docker hub repository
5) Deployed the conatainer successfully
6) Connected to the 'minikube' kubernetes dashboard and got the IP of the deployed cluster
7) Was able to access my spring-boot application using a brower as 'IP_ADDR:8080'
